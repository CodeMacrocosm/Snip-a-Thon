## Your Favorite Code Snippet ❤️

Feel free to share your favorite code snippet along with a brief comment explaining why it's your favorite. We value readability and proper indentation in code snippets. Here's an example:

```python
# This is my favorite code snippet because it calculates the Fibonacci sequence.

def Fibonacci(n): 
    if n < 0: 
        print("Incorrect input")
    elif n == 1: 
        return 0
    elif n == 2: 
        return 1
    else: 
        return Fibonacci(n - 1) + Fibonacci(n - 2)
  
print(Fibonacci(100))
```
